# xmlParser
Recursively reads an xml file and creates a tree

## Expected Behavior
When running this program, a tree of possible events will print to the console. 
A user can enter any event (e.g. Idle, Patrol, Combat) and the tree will return a randomly 
selected leaf from that event along with the number of searches it took via breadth-first and depth-first.
